# Version authority for the example kits.
#
# A kit's version lives in its descriptor: the agent kits carry it as the
# `version` arg's default — the installer pin their provide expands from —
# and the rest as the descriptor's own `version:`. For the kits whose
# version is somebody else's release, this script is the one place that
# knows where upstream publishes it, so the check report and the build
# cannot disagree about what "latest" means.
#
# gh is deliberately absent: its version authority is the nixpkgs pin in
# examples/gh/gh.dockerfile, so a bump is editing that pin (and the
# provides entry the pinned package dictates).

# without the floor publishes an adapter whose metadata lies about what
# it can drive, so the report names it and a person raises both.
